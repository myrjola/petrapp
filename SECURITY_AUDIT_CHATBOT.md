# Security Audit: AI Personal Trainer Chatbot

**Date**: September 15, 2025
**Scope**: User data isolation and security in chatbot implementation
**Status**: CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

## Executive Summary

The security audit of the AI Personal Trainer Chatbot implementation has identified critical security vulnerabilities related to user data isolation. The current implementation lacks proper user context extraction and validation, which could lead to unauthorized access to user data across conversations.

## Critical Findings

### 1. Missing User Context Extraction (CRITICAL)
**File**: `internal/chatbot/service.go`
**Issue**: The service layer does not implement user ID extraction from request context.

**Impact**: Without proper user context extraction, the chatbot service cannot enforce user isolation, potentially allowing users to access other users' conversations and data.

**Required Fix**: Implement user ID extraction using `contexthelpers.GetUserID(ctx)` or equivalent mechanism used throughout the codebase.

### 2. Incomplete Service Methods (HIGH)
**Files**: `internal/chatbot/service.go`
**Issue**: Core service methods are not implemented:
- `GetUserConversations(ctx)`
- `CreateConversation(ctx, title)`
- `ProcessMessage(ctx, conversationID, content)`

**Impact**: The service cannot function properly and security controls cannot be enforced.

### 3. Repository Interface Missing User Filtering (HIGH)
**File**: `internal/chatbot/repository.go`
**Issue**: Repository interfaces do not include user filtering parameters in method signatures.

**Impact**: Even if service layer extracts user ID, repository layer cannot enforce user isolation without API changes.

**Current Interface**:
```go
List(ctx context.Context) ([]Conversation, error)
```

**Required Interface**:
```go
ListByUser(ctx context.Context, userID int) ([]Conversation, error)
```

## Security Requirements Validation

### ✅ Proper SQL Query Structure
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
**Evidence**: Tests verify all visualization queries include `user_id` parameters for data isolation.

**Example from tests**:
```sql
SELECT workout_date as date, COUNT(*) as count
FROM workout_sessions
WHERE user_id = ?
GROUP BY workout_date ORDER BY workout_date
```

### ✅ Parameterized Queries
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
**Evidence**: All database queries use parameterized statements preventing SQL injection.

### ❌ User Context Validation
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: No mechanism to extract and validate user ID from request context.

### ❌ Cross-User Access Prevention
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: Service layer lacks user filtering in conversation and message operations.

### ✅ Database Schema Security
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
**Evidence**: Database schema includes proper foreign key constraints and user isolation fields:
- `conversations.user_id` references `users.id` with CASCADE delete
- All queries in tests include user filtering

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Before Production)

1. **Implement User Context Extraction**
   ```go
   func (s *Service) GetUserConversations(ctx context.Context) ([]Conversation, error) {
       userID, err := contexthelpers.GetUserID(ctx)
       if err != nil {
           return nil, fmt.Errorf("unauthorized: %w", err)
       }
       return s.repo.conversations.ListByUser(ctx, userID)
   }
   ```

2. **Update Repository Interfaces**
   - Add user filtering to all repository methods
   - Implement user validation in all database operations

3. **Complete Service Implementation**
   - Implement all missing service methods
   - Add user ID validation to all methods
   - Return appropriate errors for unauthorized access

### Security Testing

1. **Add Cross-User Access Tests**
   ```go
   func TestUserIsolation_ConversationAccess(t *testing.T) {
       // Test that User A cannot access User B's conversations
   }
   ```

2. **Authentication Integration Tests**
   - Test with missing user context
   - Test with invalid user ID
   - Test cross-user access attempts

### Code Review Requirements

1. All service methods must extract and validate user ID
2. All repository calls must include user filtering
3. All error paths must be tested for information leakage
4. No SQL queries without user isolation parameters

## Risk Assessment

**Current Risk Level**: HIGH
- Potential for complete user data exposure
- Unauthorized access to conversations and workout data
- Privacy violations and GDPR compliance issues

**Post-Fix Risk Level**: LOW (assuming proper implementation)

## Compliance Notes

### GDPR Implications
- Current implementation violates data minimization principles
- Risk of unauthorized personal data access
- Required: Proper user data isolation and access controls

### Security Best Practices
- ✅ Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- ❌ Missing authentication context validation
- ❌ Missing authorization checks
- ✅ Database foreign key constraints implemented

## Conclusion

The chatbot implementation has a solid foundation with proper database schema and parameterized queries, but critical security vulnerabilities exist in the service layer. These must be addressed before any production deployment.

**Recommended Timeline**:
- Critical fixes: 1-2 days
- Security testing: 1 day
- Code review and validation: 1 day

**Priority**: IMMEDIATE - Block production deployment until fixed
