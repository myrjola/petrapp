# Feature Specification: AI Personal Trainer Chatbot

**Feature Branch**: `001-personal-trainer-chatbot`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "In this workout app, implement an AI personal trainer chatbot that can query user's workout data and generate visualizations using LLM tool calling. The system should be flexible enough to handle natural language queries while maintaining strict security boundaries. There's already enabling functionality in place such as userdb package for creating isolated databases per user and tools.SecureQueryTool for executing queries securely and example implementations of ECharts visualisations in the exercise-info.gohtml template."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a fitness app user, I want to interact with an AI personal trainer through natural language conversations to get insights about my workout data, receive personalized recommendations, and visualize my progress through charts and graphs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has historical workout data, **When** they ask "How many workouts did I complete last month?", **Then** the chatbot provides an accurate count based on their data
2. **Given** a user wants to see their progress, **When** they request "Show me my bench press progression", **Then** the chatbot generates a visualization chart displaying weight/rep trends over time
3. **Given** a user asks for workout recommendations, **When** they say "What exercises should I do today?", **Then** the chatbot analyzes their workout history and suggests appropriate exercises
4. **Given** a user asks about specific exercise stats, **When** they query "What's my personal best for squats?", **Then** the chatbot retrieves and displays their maximum weight/reps for that exercise
5. **Given** multiple users are using the app, **When** User A interacts with the chatbot, **Then** they only see data from their own workouts, never from other users

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user asks about data they don't have (e.g., "Show my swimming stats" when they've never logged swimming)?
- How does system handle ambiguous queries like "Show my best" without specifying exercise or metric?
- What happens when visualization data is too large to display effectively (e.g., 5 years of daily workouts)?
- How does system respond to queries it cannot understand or process?
- What happens when user tries to access another user's data through the chatbot?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a conversational interface where users can type natural language questions about their workout data
- **FR-002**: System MUST accurately query and retrieve user's workout history data based on natural language input
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate visualizations (charts/graphs) for workout metrics when requested
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure each user can only access their own workout data through the chatbot
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide meaningful responses when unable to understand or process a query
- **FR-006**: System MUST support common fitness queries including personal records, workout frequency, exercise progression, and volume statistics
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain conversation context to handle follow-up questions
- **FR-008**: System MUST respond within 10 seconds
- **FR-009**: Visualizations MUST be interactive and display relevant metrics (weight, reps, sets, dates)
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle 100 simultaneous chatbot conversations
- **FR-011**: System MUST retain conversation history permanently
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide workout recommendations based on user's historical data and sound fitness principles

### Key Entities
- **Conversation**: Represents an interaction session between a user and the AI trainer, containing messages and context
- **ChatMessage**: Individual message in a conversation, includes user query or AI response, timestamp, and message type
- **DataQuery**: Parsed representation of user's natural language request for workout data
- **Visualization**: Chart or graph generated from workout data, includes type (line, bar, etc.) and data points
- **WorkoutInsight**: Analysis or recommendation generated by the AI based on user's workout patterns
